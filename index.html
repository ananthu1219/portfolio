    <h2><u>Biography</u></h2>

    <p><span>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</span>, born on <em>October 2, 1869</em>, in <em>Porbandar, Gujarat</em>, was a lawyer, freedom fighter, and a symbol of peace and non-violence. Reverently called <span>Mahatma</span> (Great Soul), he led India's independence movement with truth and compassion.</p>

    <p>He studied law in London and later moved to <span>South Africa</span>, where he faced racial discrimination. There, he began his journey as a civil rights activist and developed the philosophy of <span>Satyagraha</span> — non-violent resistance.</p>

    <p>Returning to India in 1915, Gandhi became the leader of major movements such as the <span>Non-Cooperation Movement</span>, the <span>Dandi Salt March</span>, and the <span>Quit India Movement</span>. He inspired millions through his belief in non-violence, unity, and self-reliance.</p>

    <p>He was tragically assassinated on <em>January 30, 1948</em>, but his life and legacy continue to inspire peace and justice movements around the world.</p>

    <div class="philosophypoint">
      <h3>Ahimsa (Non-Violence)</h3>
      <p>
        Gandhi believed that non-violence is not a weakness but a powerful tool for change. Ahimsa guided all his actions — he resisted injustice without hatred or harm, even to the oppressor.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="philosophypoint">
      <h3>Satyagraha (Truth-Force)</h3>
      <p>

      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="philosophypoint">
      <h3>Simple Living</h3>
      <p>
        Gandhi chose a life of simplicity, wearing hand-spun khadi, walking barefoot, and living in a self-sufficient community. He believed that materialism distracted people from spiritual growth.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="philosophypoint">
      <h3>Self-Reliance (Swadeshi)</h3>
      <p>
        He encouraged Indians to boycott foreign goods and support local industries. Spinning the charkha became a symbol of economic independence and national pride.

    <h3>Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)</h3>

    <h3>Dandi Salt March (Salt Satyagraha, 1930)</h3>
    <p>
      In protest of the British salt tax, Gandhi led a 240-mile march from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi. The act of making salt from seawater became a powerful symbol of civil disobedience and inspired millions to join the freedom struggle.

    <h3>Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha</h3>
